This project is an exercise on the application of the hidden markov model on the classification of vowel and consonant letters of a language (English in this exercise) based on some text information.

The text source used in this exercise is the A01 file of the Brown Corpus (The Brown Corpus of standard American English, http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn/csc401/a1res.html).

The code is based on Mark Stamp's note on the hidden markov model (https://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp/RUA/HMM.pdf) and is purely established by only using pandas and numpy package.
